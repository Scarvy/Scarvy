Hi 👋, I’m Scott, a market 📈 and technology 👨‍💻 enthusiast based in Boston, Massachusetts 🍀. In my free time, I enjoy coding (Python especially!) 🐍, playing hockey 🏒, basketball 🏀, and listening to podcasts 🎧.

I'm currently working as a Quantitative Researcher at State Street Associates, the research arm of State Street Bank 🏦.

👀 I'm looking to contribute open source projects like market APIs, data anlysis, and productivity tools.
